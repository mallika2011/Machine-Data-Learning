## Contents

<ol>
    <li><b>Assigment 1 :</b> Bias Variance Trade off - Understanding the notion of bias and variace with respect to a trained model and for different polunomial functions. 
    <li> <b>Assigment 2</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Optimal policy and reward function
        <li> Value iteration algorithm
    </ul>
    <li><b>Assigment 3 :</b> Genetic Algorithm - Appling the genetic algorithm in order to reduce the overfitting i.e. generalize the model so that the model performs better on unseen data. Algorithm performed given coefficients of features(a vector of size 10) corresponding to an overfit model and
    <li><b>Assigment 4 :</b> Decision Trees : Constructing a decision tree for a given problem statement
